A file called testplan.txt that contains a test plan for your indexer. You should include the
example files and/or directories that you test your indexer on but keep these from being too
large, please. (We might test your program with a very large data set though so donâ€™t skip
testing your program for scalability. In your test plan, you should discuss the larger scale
testing and the results, but you can skip including the data set).

Test Case 1: Reading a file from a directory with nothing else in the directory besides the file
Test Case 2: Reading a file from a directory with other files in the directory
Test Case 3: Reading a file from a directory with other directories in it
Test Case 4: Reading a file from a directory with another directory which has the same file name in that directory
Test Case 5: Reading a very large file
Test Case 6: Trying to read a file which does not exist
