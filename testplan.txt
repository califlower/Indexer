Test Cases for Index by Saif Saiyed and Cal Gilan:

TEST PLAN: Our program has worked for the following test cases which include very large text files (For our testing we used several text files but our main testing file is a file called big.txt which is included with our program) 

***To use our program properly, YOU MUST properly define the source path and destination directory.***

For Example: (ON MY LAPTOP)
/Users/Saif/a.out "/Users/Saif/Desktop/testcases/testinthis.txt" "/Users/Saif/Desktop/testcases/comb/"

Properly Define In First Quotations "Your Destination and File Output Path" 
Properly Define in Second Quotations "Your Source Directory"
*MAKE SURE TO GET THESE CORRECTLY OTHERWISE PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK*

(Files and Directories are included inside the Test Case folder which is included with this program) 

Test Case 1: Reading a file from a directory with nothing else in the directory besides the file
Test Case 2: Reading a file from a directory with other files in the directory
Test Case 3: Reading a file from a directory with other directories in it
Test Case 4: Reading a file from a directory with another directory which has the same file name in that directory
Test Case 5: Reading an empty directory
Test Case 6: Reading from a directory which does not exist
